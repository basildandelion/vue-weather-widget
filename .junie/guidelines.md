# Weather Widget Project Guidelines

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a weather widget using Vue 3 and Vite. The weather widget will allow users to:
- View current weather conditions for a location
- See weather forecasts
- Search for weather in different locations
- Toggle between different units (Celsius/Fahrenheit)
- View additional weather data (humidity, wind speed, etc.)

## Team Structure and Roles

### My Role (Team Lead)
As your team lead and teacher on this project, I will:
- Provide code reviews and feedback on your implementations
- Create task lists and prioritize features
- Offer guidance on best practices and architectural decisions
- Answer questions and provide explanations
- Help troubleshoot issues without directly fixing them

### Your Role (Developer)
As the developer, you will:
- Implement the features based on the task lists
- Write clean, maintainable code following Vue best practices
- Create unit tests for your components
- Address feedback from code reviews
- Ask questions when you need clarification

## Code Review Process
1. When you complete a task, submit your code for review
2. I will review your code and provide comments on:
   - Code quality and readability
   - Component structure and reusability
   - Performance considerations
   - Potential bugs or edge cases
   - Adherence to Vue best practices
3. You will address the feedback and resubmit if necessary

## Task Management
I will create task lists that include:
- Feature description and requirements
- Acceptance criteria
- Priority level
- Estimated complexity
- Relevant resources or references

Tasks will be organized into sprints or milestones to track progress.

## Development Guidelines

### Project Structure
- Follow the Vue 3 Composition API patterns
- Organize components logically in the src/components directory
- Use the router for any multi-page functionality
- Implement state management using Pinia for shared state
- Keep API calls in separate service files

### Coding Standards
- Use ESLint for code linting (npm run lint)
- Write meaningful component and function names
- Include comments for complex logic
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle
- Use TypeScript for type safety where appropriate

### Testing
- Write unit tests for components using Vitest
- Aim for good test coverage of critical functionality
- Run tests before submitting code (npm run test:unit)

## Getting Started
1. Familiarize yourself with the project structure
2. Set up your development environment following the README.md instructions
3. Review the first task list (to be provided)
4. Begin implementation and submit for review

Remember, I'm here to guide you through the process, but I won't be writing or fixing code directly. This approach helps you learn and grow as a developer while still having the support you need to succeed.
